This is probably the longest list of pre-industrial baseline (PIB) definition references on the entire Internet, including all of ipcc.ch and unfcc.int. It turns out this crucial baseline is all, but well defined. I found only few organizations using it internally consistently.
{: .tldr }

## What's the problem with the pre-industrial baseline? 

Well, it doesn't refer to a timespan with a starting and an end point. It appeals to common sense and lacks scientific rigidity. Speaking strictly it ranges from Big Bang to somewhen before the first World War. That's a range of over 13 billon years. Let's say we ignore dinosaurs and focus on humans only it would refer to the Holocene. Which is also very impracticable with only a few less magnitudes. Also humans began altering the Planet's climate at large scale with [agriculture 12,000 years](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-humans-first-alte/) ago and continued with the deforastation of Europe in the Middle Ages.

Ignoring that too, leads to the question: When did the industrial revolution kick in? It's hard to pinpoint an exact day, but I'll give you two characteristic reference points. As early as 1712 Thomas Newcomen unveiled the first economically succesful steam-driven piston engine, which allowed the more efficient pumping of deep mines. By 1800 perhaps 2,000 steam engines were at work in Britain. The revolutionary aspect was that they replaced human labor with machine labor driven by hydrocarbons. James Watt improved the design further and released his Watt engine to the market in 1774. However, all designs included burning carbon to produce the heat to boil water.

Another time changing machine - the 'spinning jenny' - was invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill. Its yarn was not of the best quality, ![Spinning Jenny](/articles/the-pre-industrial-baseline/Havgreaves_Spinning_Jenny.png){: .move-right} yet decreased prices and workload enough that a mob destroyed Hargreaves' machines four years later and forced him to flee to Nottingham. But 'jenny' was unstoppable, by 1788 nearly 20,000 of them were being employed. A textile industry supported by machines helped to cloth England's rapidly growing population and was a major driver of the industrial revolution. Side-effects included the first union in 1870 and occupational diseases in form of scrotal cancer upcoming around 1900.

These two points only scratch the surface of a deep transformation of about every aspect of human life. In short the industrial revolution gave us sweatshops and machines converting carbon into cheap labour. It started the dark age of technology emitting an increasing amount of climate altering carbondioxyd measured today in gigatons per year.

I leave it now up to you to define "pre-industrial". Everything between 1700 and 1850 is probably a good guess as shown above and will be further below. I'd like to refer you to Wikipedia and the British Library for further studies. Just keep in mind the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/) is able to provide a record of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions starting in 1751 because ice cores taken in Antarctica show a significant amount of Carbon-13.

Which brings me back to the original issue: COP21 promised to keep temperature increase below 2°C from a "pre-industrial baseline" to avoid dangerous climate change.

## What is the global temperature today?

Actually nobody knows. The relevant institutes agree on anomalies but less on absolutes.

The IPCC started with 1990 baseline, but changed it after AR3 reports. The European Environment Agency, Copenhagen, states very diplomatically there is only little difference between the 1750 and the 1850 baseline, at least for european land temperatures. If C02 is taken as relevant metric industrialization started mostly 1750 (there is a good dataset). 

I've ignore minor irritations whether the baseline should range from 1850 to 1879 (30 years) or to 1880 (31 years).

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

 The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. Today, it has near-universal membership. The 197 countries that have ratified the Convention are called Parties to the Convention. The convention has been ratified by countries all over the world, not only those
that  have  ratified  the  Kyoto  protocol. 

The UNFCCC is a “Rio Convention”, one of three adopted at the “Rio Earth Summit” in 1992.

GHG concentrations is a key indicator relevant to  international climate negotiations as the overall objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is 

> The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.  

[UNITED NATIONS, Rio de Jainero, 1992 ](https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf).


> Further recognizes that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required according to science, and as documented in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, with a view to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions so as **to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels**, and that Parties should take urgent action to meet this long-term goal, consistent with science and on the basis of equity; also recognizes the need to consider, in the context of the first review, as referred to in paragraph 138 below, strengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, including in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1.5 °C;

## Agriculture

Norman F. Cantor's summary of the effects of late medieval deforestation applies equally well to Early Modern Europe:[94]

> Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 they were running short of wood for heating and cooking. They were faced with a nutritional decline because of the elimination of the generous supply of wild game that had inhabited the now-disappearing forests, which throughout medieval times had provided the staple of their carnivorous high-protein diet. By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize.

## Social Science

> Pre-industrial society refers to social attributes and forms of political and cultural organization that were prevalent before the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which occurred from 1750 to 1850. Pre-industrial is a time before there were machines and tools to help perform tasks en masse.

The evidence printed here is taken from the large body published in the committee's report and is representative rather than exceptional. It will be observed that the questions are frequently leading; this reflects Sadler's knowledge of the sort of information that the committee were to hear and his purpose of bringing it out. This report stands out as one of three great reports on the life of the industrial class — the two others being that of the Ashley Commission on the mines and 's report on sanitary problems.

### CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE: AVOIDING THE UNMANAGEABLE AND MANAGING THE UNAVOIDABLE

> The situation can be clarified in quantitative terms as follows. Consideration of the projected impacts of further climate change has led a number of respectable analysts  and  groups,  including  the  European  Union,  to  conclude  that  society should  seek **to  stabilize  the  global-average  surface  temperature  at  a  value  not more than 2°C above that of 1750**; others have suggested figures from 1.5°C to 4.5°C as the increases above the 1750 value that ought not to be exceeded (see, e.g., WBGU, 2003; International Climate Change Task Force, 2005; European Commission,  2005;  Mastrandrea  and  Schneider,  2004;  Hansen,  2005).

> For the period prior to 1860, average surface temperatures must be inferred from indirect indicators derived from  the  study  of  ice  cores,  tree  rings,  sediments,  and  the  like.  A  recent  review  of  these  “temperature reconstructions” by the U.S. National Academies suggests that natural variability was more important than any net  effect  of  human  influences  in  the  period  from  1750  to  1860  and  that,  taken  together,  the  available reconstructions  do  not  show  any  meaningful  difference  between  the  temperature  of  1750  and  that  of  1860 (NRC, 2006). Thus, **we may take 0.75°C as a reasonable estimate of the temperature increase over the whole period from 1750 to 2000.**

### Earth now halfway to UN global warming limit, 29 July 2015

> The UN negotiations on climate change aim to limit warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures. There is, however, no agreement on how to define pre-industrial temperature, says Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading, UK.

> Because some global temperature records only begin in 1880, the period 1880 to 1899 is the easiest “pre-industrial” baseline for measuring warming. It is somewhat misleading, though, because the 1880s were particularly cold after the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano. The period 1850 to 1899 is a better baseline, says Hawkins.

3. Justification of the topic 
Much of the discussion about mitigation options have been focussed on a +2-degree threshold. 
This threshold, initially introduced by the EU, refers to the pre-industrial baseline. However, the 
climate projections presented in WGI refer to t
he 1990 baseline. This difference is confusing and 
probably is not noticed by many readers. It makes any communication and discussion extremely 
difficult. It also masks the problem, that the +2-degree threshold, which corresponds to a +1.5-
degree threshold compared to 1990, is a scenario barely within the scenario range discussed in 
WG I. 



> Baseline used for this figure is not given. It should be replotted using a preindustrial baseline, e.g. 1850-1900. In the current version, temperature rises under the RCP4.5 scenario reach 2 C above the baseline whereas this report discusses RCP2.6 as the only scenario which can limit global warming to 2 C or less.

> This section deals with defining baseline information for assessing climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability The baseline refers to a reference state or behaviour of a system, e.g. current biodiversity of an ecosystem, or a reference state of factors (e.g. agricultural activity, climate) which influence that system (see Glossary entry). For example, the UNFCCC defines the pre-industrial baseline climate, prior to atmospheric composition changes from its baseline pre-industrial state, as a reference for measuring global average temperature rises.

>  "broad scientific view" with respect to 2C is that it relates to above 1990 levels - not preind
ustrial 
levels.  This (1990) level was referenced in the Burning Embers figure from WG2 of AR3.  It is only political 
agreements that have claimed this to be against a pre-industrial baseline.

> The annual deviations shown in the chart have been **adjusted to be relative to the period 1850-1899 to better monitor the EU objective not to exceed 2°C above pre-industrial values. Over Europe average annual temperatures during the real pre-industrial period (1750-1799) were very similar to those during 1850-99.** 

http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/global-and-european-temperature/global-and-european-temperature-assessment-4


> According to the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007), there is very high confidence that the net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming. Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.

http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/global-and-european-temperature-1


> Global average annual temperature deviations, ‘anomalies’, are discussed relative to a ‘pre-industrial’ period between 1850 and 1899 (beginning of instrumental temperature records).  During this time, anthropogenic greenhouse gases from the industrial revolution (between 1750 and 1850) are considered to have a relatively small influence on climate compared to natural influences. However it should be noted that owing to earlier changes in the climate due to internal and forced natural variability there was not one single pre-industrial climate and it is not clear that there is a rigorous scientific definition of the term ‘pre-industrial climate’.

> Global average annual temperature is expressed here relative to a ‘pre-industrial’ baseline period of 1850 to 1899, and this period coincides with the beginning of widespread instrumental temperature records.

http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/global-and-european-temperature/global-and-european-temperature-assessment-6



> If one trillion tonnes of carbon (1 TtC), (equivalent to 3,670 billion tonnes of CO2) accumulate in the atmosphere from long-term human influences (from the pre-industrial baseline 1750 to the year 2500), the most likely temperature rise from climate change would peak at 2 ºC above pre-industrial levels. Together with a companion study 2, 3, it suggests that it has taken 250 years for humankind to burn half a trillion tonnes of carbon. If the current rate continues, it would only take a further 40 years to burn the next half trillion tonnes.
